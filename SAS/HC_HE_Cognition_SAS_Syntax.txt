*ebonfowl: get data into SAS;

proc import datafile="C:\Users\amcampit\Downloads\DCM Time 2 Data Analysis Set.Corrected.xlsx"
out=COG dbms=xlsx replace;
run;

*Basic t-tests where class is the grouping variable (sex);

proc ttest data=COG alpha=.05;
var RBTOIT1;
class SEX;
run;

proc ttest data=COG alpha=.05;
var ECOGT1;
class SEX;
run;

*ebonfowl: many descriptive stats pooled and grouped by class; 
*normaltest option provides tests of normality;

proc univariate data=COG normaltest;
class GROUP SEX;
var RBTOIT1 RBTOIT2 ECOGT1 ECOGT2;
run;

*ebonfowl: factorial ANOVA (2x2x2) model with 2 between factors (group, sex) and 1 within factor (RBTOIT1 RBTOIT2);
*nouni option prevents running more univariate stats;
*summary option generates ANOVA tables for each within contrast and the between IV effects;
*printe option outputs the E matrix for all combinations and tests for sphericity;

proc glm data=COG;
class GROUP SEX;
model RBTOIT1 RBTOIT2 = GROUP SEX/nouni;
repeated time 2/summary printe;
run;

*ebonfowl: as above, but only one between factor (group);

proc glm data=COG;
class GROUP;
model ECOGT1 ECOGT2 = GROUP/nouni;
repeated time 2/summary printe;
run;
