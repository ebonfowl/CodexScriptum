    # 2) Find the midpoint (m) of the first 50% of samples
    # 3) Find the directional vector (dv) for the throw by running trans_global and minus_g on the vector at m, we will transform in the direction of this vector in subsequent steps - maybe average a few samples before and after to control for wobble, could even average the direction vectors for the full 50%
    # 4) Compute the global vector (v) for each sample by applying trans_global and minus_g to the local vector, store vectors in data frame
    # 5) For each global vector (v) in the df, find the angle between v and dv (a) with angle_between, set angle a into df
    # 6) Find the magnitude of global vector (v) in the direction of dv by applying ||v||*cos(a) via the outcome_mag function
    # 7) Now you have all your accelerations in the direction of movement and it is just basic algebra going forward to get velocity for each acceleration
    # 8) Then simply a*(mass of the ball)*v will yield instant power for each sample
