# CodexScriptum
Scripts I made for research and data analysis

# NTValidation.R 
R script that runs all the stats for the validation of a novel digital neuropsych battery 

# PrelimSEM.R 
R script that fits CFA and SEM models for latent measures of muscle quality and walking ability and reports fit indices 

# RonsCode.py 
Python workflow for creating gene transcription trajectories using dynamo 
Note: this is not working code, rather it was created as a template for another researcher who was unfamiliar with omics work in python 

# TOST_power.R 
R script that runs a power analysis for a TOST test of equivalency with given upper and lower equivalency bounds. 
Used in a study validating power measured with a linear position transducer in the sit-to-stand against gold standard motion analysis and force plate. 

# TOST_power2.py 
Python script that runs a power analysis for a TOST test of equivalency using a proportional acceptance region.
Used in a preliminary power analysis for the RepOne validation study.
