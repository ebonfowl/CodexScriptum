# CodexScriptum
Scripts I made for research and data analysis

# NTValidation.R 
R script that runs all the stats for the validation of a novel digital neuropsych battery 

# PrelimSEM.R 
R script that fits CFA and SEM models for latent measures of muscle quality and walking ability and reports fit indices 

# RonsCode.py 
Workflow for creating gene transcription trajectories using dynamo 
Note: this is not working code, rather it was created as a template for another researcher who was unfamiliar with omics work in python
